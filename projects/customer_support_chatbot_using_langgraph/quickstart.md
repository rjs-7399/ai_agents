## Booking and Cancellation

1. How can I change my booking?
	* The ticket number must start with 724 (SWISS ticket no./plate).
	* The ticket was not paid for by barter or voucher (there are exceptions to voucher payments; if the ticket was paid for in full by voucher, then it may be possible to rebook online under certain circumstances. If it is not possible to rebook online because of the payment method, then you will be informed accordingly during the rebooking process).
	* There must be an active flight booking for your ticket. It is not possible to rebook open tickets or tickets without the corresponding flight segments online at the moment.
	* It is currently only possible to rebook outbound (one-way) tickets or return tickets with single flight routes (point-to-point).
2. Which tickets/bookings cannot be rebooked online currently?
	* Bookings containing flight segments with other airlines
	* Bookings containing reservations, where a ticket has not yet been issued
	* Bookings with several valid tickets for the same person and route
	* Tickets with a status other than O (open) (A)
	* Bookings with segments with a status other than OK (e.g. containing flight segments with the status Waitlist) (HK|RR)

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Yes, you are allowed to update your flight to something sooner, provided that your ticket meets certain conditions. Here are the key points regarding flight changes:

1. **Eligibility**: Your ticket must start with "724" (which it does), and it must have an active flight booking.

2. **Timeframe**: You can rebook your flight online up to three hours before departure if you are departing from a Swiss airport.

3. **Changes Allowed**: You can change the flight and travel dates, but changes to the origin, destination, or name are not permitted online.

4. **Fees**: Depending on your fare conditions, there may be fees associated with changing your flight.

Since you want to leave later today, I can help you search for available flights. Would you like me to do that? If so, please provide the departure airport and any preferred arrival airport.
